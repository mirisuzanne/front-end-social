sub: From server costs to moderation efforts
---

It takes
time and effort and money
to manage a server like this one.

Donations are not required, and don't buy membership --
but they do help us keep things running.
We expect the domain/server to cost roughly
$500-600 USD each year.
Admin & moderation tasks vary week-to-week,
but add up quickly,
and can be emotionally taxing.
We'll do our best to keep things running,
and safe for all our members --
but contributions help cover
both the fixed costs and effort involved.

Support us
(and see current contributors) at
[buymeacoffee.com/terriblemia](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/terriblemia).
If you can: low-level memberships help
keep the costs low for everyone,
while ensuring long-term stability.

All your generosity is very much appreciated!
