title: Registration and Invitations
sub: General registrations is currently on hold
---

We're so grateful for the enthusiasm we've received,
and we're enjoying getting to know new faces
(as well as connect with some old ones).
While we’re excited to be part of
a larger extended ‘fediverse’ community,
we need to keep this server at a size
that we’re able to afford, maintain, and moderate.
We think that number is somewhere under 350 members.

As the interest (and membership)
has grown much faster than expected,
we've had to pause both member-invites and registrations for now.
We're managing this space in our spare time,
and know that we're not ready for the rapid growth
that many other servers have experienced.
We don't intend to be an exclusive club,
but we also aren't set up to be
a central hub for all things front-end.
We hope that others will start similar spaces,
and we can build our community as a federated network,
rather than centralizing on one domain.

It has also been clear from the early registrations
that leaving the process unchecked
would result in a user base that's overwhelmingly cis, white, and male.
Since we paused registration,
the same pattern has played out in
our DMs and emails --
with primarily white men expecting special invites
(and getting hostile when denied).
We believe it's important
to push against that trend.
We want to work actively toward developing
a community that's diverse and inviting
to everyone who shares these values --
and we want your help.

### Current Members Can Request Invites

If you have friends or co-workers
that you think might want to join our community,
_particularly those that are a different gender or ethnicity than your own_,
message [@mods](https://front-end.social/@mods) via DM
and we will see about getting some invites out.

### General Registration Process

We are working to improve the application process
with a few more questions
directing new users to think in this regard as well.
If you are part of a marginalized group,
and looking for a smaller/safer home base,
feel free to reach out.
Otherwise,
we are not accepting new registrations at the moment --
including requests through email or DM.

Thanks again for bearing with us!
