title: Registration and Invitations
sub: General registration is currently on hold

We are not accepting registrations at this time.
If you know someone on the server,
feel free to reach at to them and request an invite.

We're so grateful for the enthusiasm we've received.
While we’re excited to be part of
a larger extended ‘fediverse’ community,
we need to keep this server at a size
that we’re able to maintain, moderate, and afford
in our spare time.

We hope that others will start similar spaces,
and we can build our community as a federated network,
rather than centralizing on one domain.

### Current Members Can Create & Send Invites

If you have friends or co-workers
that you want to invite to join our community,
_particularly those that are a different gender or ethnicity than your own_,
you can find the _invite people_ page
in your preferences.

We can't adjust the options listed,
but ask you to avoid creating large-number invites
to post publicly.
